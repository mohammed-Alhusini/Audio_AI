# Audio AI 


## Project Overview
This project creates an interactive tool that lets you chat with audio transcripts, asking for summaries or other tasks, all through an easy to use interface.


## Audio Handling and Processing:

The system uses pydub to load, process, and split audio files into smaller chunks if they exceed 10 minutes.



## UI:

I used Gradio to create the interface for uploading audio, getting transcriptions, and viewing summaries.
